# ðŸ’» Laptop Request Catalog Item â€“ ServiceNow Project

Hi! Iâ€™m **Gonnabattula Likhita**, a ServiceNow enthusiast and ITSM developer. I enjoy building practical, user-centric solutions that simplify complex workflows and improve service delivery. This project showcases my ability to create dynamic Service Catalog items that streamline organizational workflows and enhance user experience.

## About this Project

I chose this project to address the common challenge organizations face with manual laptop request processes that are slow and prone to errors. By creating a dynamic Laptop Request Catalog Item in ServiceNow, I learned how to leverage UI Policies, Client Scripts, and Update Sets to build efficient and user-friendly solutions. This project helped me deepen my understanding of ServiceNowâ€™s Service Catalog capabilities and improve my skills in automating IT service workflows.

## Prerequisites and Tools Used

- A ServiceNow Developer Instance (or any ServiceNow instance with Service Catalog access)  
- Knowledge of Service Catalog Items and Variables  
- Familiarity with Catalog UI Policies and Client Scripts  
- Update Sets for moving customizations between instances  
- Basic JavaScript for UI Actions and Client Scripts  


## How to Use / Deploy

1. Create a local Update Set named **Laptop Request** and make it current.  
2. Build the Service Catalog item with variables for Laptop Model, Justification, Accessories, and Accessories Details.  
3. Configure Catalog UI Policies to dynamically show and require Accessories Details when Additional Accessories checkbox is checked.  
4. Create a Client-side UI Action to reset the form fields.  
5. Test the catalog item in the Service Catalog under Hardware category.  
6. Export and import update sets for deployment across instances.
